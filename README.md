Modified the game after watching the first project at greatcodeclub.com

Simple Rules:
=================
If the ball hits the wall with a "red" ball inside an additional ball appears on the screen.  Please note this is not the primary ball though.

Losing is determined if the primary ball, which is the ball, with a circle marker inside touches the ground.
