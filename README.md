Modified the game after watching the first project at greatcodeclub.com

Simple Rules:
=================
If the ball hits the wall with a "red" ball inside an additional ball appears on the screen.  Please note this is not the primary ball though.

Losing is determined if the primary ball, which is the ball, with a circle marker inside touches the ground.

NOTE
=======
I am about to refactor the app based on feedback and some common practices.  This was just a quick prototype created for demonstrating HTML5 game development to my 8 year old nephew.
